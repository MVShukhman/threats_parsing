Kryptik is able to open TCP or UDP ports and generates the variety of URLs to connect to the cybercriminals\u2019 server. The communication process is carried out via HTTP protocol. The traffic is encrypted with RC4 crypto algorithm. Beside data stealing, Kryptik performs many other malicious actions, among them: monitors and modifies network traffic, shuts down or restarts the infected machine, changes web browser\u2019s home page, manipulates digital certificates, logs keystrokes, captures screenshots, deploys a proxy server, installs and runs other malware etc. Kryptic it self-replicated malware, so it easily spreads within a network, infecting other machines, and turns compromised systems into a part of a botnet. Once the installation process is over, the malware terminates its initial executable file for better covering traces.", "Modifications": "There are many versions of Kryptik, which differ from each other by additional malicious actions and features for hiding and obfuscation.
