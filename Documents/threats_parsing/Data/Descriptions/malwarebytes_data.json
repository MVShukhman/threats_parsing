But to be effective on networked machines, you must first follow these steps:\n\nIdentify the infected machine(s).\nDisconnect the infected machines from the network.\nPatch for EternalBlue.\nDisable Administrative Shares.\nRemove the Trickbot Trojan.\nChange account credentials.\n\nIdentifying the infected machines\nIf you have unprotected endpoints/machines, you can run Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST) to look for possible Indicators of Compromise (IOC). Besides verifying an infection, FRST can also be used to verify removal before bringing an endpoint/machine back into the network.\nDisabling Administrative Shares\nWindows server shares by default install hidden share folders specifically for administrative access to other machines. The Admin$ shares are used by Trickbot once it has brute forced the local administrator password. A file share sever has an IPC$ share that Trickbot queries to get a list of all endpoints that connect to it. These AdminIP shares are normally protected via UAC, however, Windows will allow the local administrator through with no prompt.\nThe most recent Trickbot variants use C$ with the Admin credentials to move around and re-infect all the other endpoints.\nRepeated re-infections are an indication the worm was able to guess or brute force the administrator password successfully. Please change all local and domain administrator passwords.\nIt is recommended to disable these Admin$ shares via the registry, as discussed\u00a0here. If you do not see this registry key, it can be added manually and set up to be disabled.\nTo remove the Trickbot Trojan using Malwarebytes business products, follow the instructions below.\nHow to remove Trojan.TrickBot with\u00a0Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection\n\nGo to the Malwarebytes Cloud console.\nTo allow you to invoke a scan while the machine is off the network, go to\u00a0Settings\u00a0>\u00a0Policies\u00a0>\u00a0your policy\u00a0>\u00a0General.\nUnder\u00a0Endpoint Interface Options,\u00a0turn ON:\n\nShow Malwarebytes icon in notification area\nAllow users to run a Threat Scan (all threats will be quarantined automatically)\n\n\nTemporarily enable Anti-Rootkit scanning for all invoked threat scans.\nGo to\u00a0Settings\u00a0>\u00a0Policies\u00a0>\u00a0your policy\u00a0>\u00a0Endpoint Protection\u00a0>\u00a0Scan Options\nSet\u00a0Scan Rootkits\u00a0to ON.\n\nOnce the endpoint has been updated with the latest policy changes:\n\nTake the client off the network\nFrom the system tray icon, run an Anti-Rootkit threat scan.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have infected machines that are not registered endpoints in Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection, you can remove Trickbot with our Breach Remediation tool (Malwarebytes Incident Response).\n", "Home remediation": "\nHome remediation\nMalwarebytes can detect and remove Trojan.Trickbot without further user interaction.\n\nPlease download Malwarebytes to your desktop.\nDouble-click MBSetup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program.\nWhen your Malwarebytes for Windows installation completes, the program opens to the Welcome to Malwarebytes screen.\nClick on the Get started button.\nClick Scan to start a Threat Scan.\nClick Quarantine to remove the found threats.\nReboot the system if prompted to complete the removal process.\n\n"}}, {"name": "Spyware.Vidar", "url": "https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/spyware-vidar/", "source_keyword": "malwarebytes", "info": {"Short bio": "\nShort bio\nSpyware.Vidar is Malwarebytes\u2019 detection name for an information stealer sold under the name VIDAR Pro Stealer.\n\n", "Type and source of infection": "\nType and source of infection\nSpyware.Vidar is a product that offers threat actors the option to set their preferences for the stolen information.

Usually they are implemented as scripts (VB, batch) or small applications.\nThey don\u2019t carry any malicious activities by themselves, but instead open a way for attack by downloading/decompressing and installing the core malicious modules. To avoid detection, a dropper may also create noise around the malicious module by downloading/decompressing some harmless files.\nDownloaders often appear in non-persistent form. They install the malicious module and remove themselves automatically. In such a case, after a single deployment they are no longer a threat. If for some reason they haven\u2019t removed themselves, they can be deleted manually.\nMore dangerous variants are persistent. They copy themselves to some random, hidden file and create registry keys to run after the system is restarted, attempting to download the malicious modules again. In such cases, to get rid of the downloader it is necessary to find and remove the created keys and the hidden file.\nDownloaders and droppers emerged from the idea of malware files that were able to download additional modules (e.g. Agobot, released in 2002).\nAn interesting example of a modern downloader is OnionDuke (discovered in 2014), carried by infected Tor nodes. It is a wrapper over legitimate software. When a user downloads software via an infected Tor proxy, OnionDuke packs the original file and adds a malicious stub to it. When the downloaded file is run, the stub first downloads malware and installs it on a computer, and then unpacks the legitimate file and removes itself in order to be unnoticed.\nMost of the time, the user gets infected by using some unauthenticated online resources. Infections are often consequences of activities like:\n\nClicking malicious links or visiting shady websites\nDownloading unknown free programs\nOpening attachments sent with spam\nPlugging infected drives\nUsing Infected proxy (like in case of OnionDuke)\n\nThey may also be installed without user interaction, carried by various exploit kits.\n", "Protection": "\nProtection\nMalwarebytes protects users from Trojan.Dropper by using real-time protection.\nMalwarebytes blocks Trojan.Dropper\n", "Remediation": "\nRemediation\nMalwarebytes can detect and remove Trojan.Dropper without further user interaction.\n\nPlease download Malwarebytes to your desktop.\nDouble-click MBSetup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program.\nWhen your Malwarebytes for Windows installation completes, the program opens to the Welcome to Malwarebytes screen.\nClick on the Get started button.\nClick Scan to start a Threat Scan.\nClick Quarantine to remove the found threats.\nReboot the system if prompted to complete the removal process.\n\n"}}, {"name": "Trojan.Egguard.PrxySvrRST", "url": "https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-egguard/", "source_keyword": "malwarebytes", "info": {"Short bio": "\nShort bio\nTrojan.Egguard.PrxySvrRST is Malwarebytes\u2019 detection name for a type of\u00a0Trojan\u00a0that injects downloaded JavaScript (JS) files into browser sessions.\n", "Type and source of infection": "\nType and source of infection\nTrojan.Egguard.PrxySvrRST sets a proxy accompanied with a false SSL certificate to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\nThe installer\u00a0for this Trojan was included in bundlers.\nProxy settings by Trojan.Egguard.PrxySvrRST\n", "Protection": "\nProtection\nMalwarebytes protects users from Trojan.Egguard by using real-time protection:\nMalwarebytes blocks Trojan.Egguard\nAs well as the Anti-Exploit module:\nMalwarebytes blocks the Trojan.Egguard exploit\n", "Remediation": "\nRemediation\nMalwarebytes can detect and remove Trojan.Egguard.PrxySvrRST without further user interaction.\n\nPlease download Malwarebytes to your desktop.\nDouble-click MBSetup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program.\nWhen your Malwarebytes for Windows installation completes, the program opens to the Welcome to Malwarebytes screen.\nClick on the Get started button.\nClick Scan to start a Threat Scan.\nClick Quarantine to remove the found threats.\nReboot the system if prompted to complete the removal process.\n\nMalwarebytes removes the proxy completely, so if you were using a proxy before the infection, this will have to be reset.\n", "Traces/IOCs": "\nTraces/IOCs\nAssociated folder:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Network\\Dsq\n\n"}}, {"name": "Trojan.ElectrumDoSMiner", "url": "https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-electrumdosminer/", "source_keyword": "malwarebytes", "info": {"Short bio": "\nShort bio\nTrojan.ElectrumDoSMiner is Malwarebytes\u2019 detection name for a Trojan responsible for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against Electrum bitcoin wallets.\n", "Symptoms": "\nSymptoms\nUsers of affected computers may experience slowdowns in internet speed as they are joined to a botnet that performs DDoS attacks.\n", "Type and source of the infection": "\nType and source of the infection\nTrojan.ElectrumDoSMiner can be dropped by exploit kits as well as by other Trojans known as Trojan.BeamWinHTTP and Smoke Loader.\nThis Trojan uses a Trojanized wallet to flood Electrum nodes with requests.\nFlooding ElectrumX servers on port 50002 or 50001\n", "Protection": "\nProtection\nMalwarebytes protects users from Trojan.ElectrumDoSMiner by using real-time protection.\nMalwarebytes also blocks the known IPs that host the botnet Trojan.\nMalwarebytes blocks the IP 178.159.37.113\n", "Remediation": "\nRemediation\nMalwarebytes can detect and remove Trojan.ElectrumDoSMiner without further user interaction.\n\nPlease download Malwarebytes to your desktop.\nDouble-click MBSetup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program.\nWhen your Malwarebytes for Windows installation completes, the program opens to the Welcome to Malwarebytes screen.\nClick on the Get started button.\nClick Scan to start a Threat Scan.\nClick Quarantine to remove the found threats.\nReboot the system if prompted to complete the removal process.\n\n", "Traces/IOCs": "\nTraces/IOCs\nElectrumDoSMiner infrastructure\n178.159.37.113  \r\n194.63.143.226  \r\n217.147.169.179\r\n188.214.135.174\nTrojan.BeamWinHTTP\n48dcb183ff97a05fd3e466f76f385543480abb62c9adcae24d1bdbbfc26f9e5a\n"}}, {"name": "Trojan.Elex", "url": "https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-elex/", "source_keyword": "malwarebytes", "info": {"Short bio": "\nShort bio\nTrojan.Elex is Malwarebytes\u2019 detection name for a family of\u00a0adware variants that go to any lengths to infiltrate and stay on user systems.

A file share sever has an IPC$ share that Emotet queries to get a list of all endpoints that connect to it. These AdminIP shares are normally protected via UAC, however, Windows will allow the local administrator through with no prompt.\nThe most recent Emotet variants use C$ with the Admin credentials to move around and re-infect all the other endpoints.\nRepeated re-infections are an indication the worm was able to guess or brute force the administrator password successfully. Please change all local and domain administrator passwords.\nIt is recommended to disable these Admin$ shares via the registry, as discussed\u00a0here.

These emails may appear to come from trusted sources, as Trojan.Emotet takes over the email accounts of its victims. This helps trick users into downloading the Trojan onto their machine.\nOnce Trojan.Emotet.Generic has infected a networked machine, it will propagate by enumerating network resources and write to share drives, as well as brute force user accounts. Infected machines attempt to spread Emotet laterally via brute forcing of domain credentials, as well as externally via its built-in spam module. As a result, the Emotet botnet is quite active and responsible for much of the malspam we encounter.\n", "Aftermath": "\nAftermath\nTrojan.Emotet.Generic is changed regularly, and therefore hard to detect by signatures.\nDue to the way Emotet spreads through a company\u2019s network, any infected machine on the network will re-infect machines that have been previously cleaned when they rejoin the network. Therefore, IT teams need to isolate, patch, and remediate each infected system one-by-one. Cleaning an affected network is a procedure that can take a long time\u2014sometimes even months\u2014depending on the number of machines involved.\n", "Protection": "\nProtection\nBusiness and home users already using Malwarebytes are protected from Trojan.Emotet.Generic via our anti-exploit technology:\n\nMalwarebytes users are also protected from Emotet via our real-time protection module:\n\n", "Business remediation": "\nBusiness remediation\nMalwarebytes can detect and remove Trojan.Emotet.Generic on business endpoints without further user interaction.

Besides verifying an infection, FRST can also be used to verify removal before bringing an endpoint/machine back into the network. Refer to\u00a0Farbar Recovery Scan Tool instructions for details on how to install and run a FRST scan.\nSearch the FRST.txt file for the following IOCs:\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\SERVICES\\1A345B7\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\SERVICES\\12C4567D\n(Gornyk) C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\servicedcom.exe\nC:\\WINDOWS\\12345678.EXE\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSWOW64\\SERVERNV.EXE\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSWOW64\\NUMB3R2ANDL3373RS.EXE\nC:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP\\1A2B.TMP\n\nDisabling Administrative Shares\nWindows server shares by default install hidden share folders specifically for administrative access to other machines. The Admin$ shares are used by Emotet once it has brute forced the local administrator password. A file share sever has an IPC$ share that Emotet queries to get a list of all endpoints that connect to it. These AdminIP shares are normally protected via UAC, however, Windows will allow the local administrator through with no prompt.\nThe most recent Emotet variants use C$ with the Admin credentials to move around and re-infect all the other endpoints.\nRepeated re-infections are an indication the worm was able to guess or brute force the administrator password successfully. Please change all local and domain administrator passwords.\nIt is recommended to disable these Admin$ shares via the registry, as discussed\u00a0here. If you do not see this registry key, it can be added manually and set up to be disabled.\nTo remove the Emotet Trojan using Malwarebytes business products, follow the instructions below.\nHow to
